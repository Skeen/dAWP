\section*{Drag-and-drop with jQuery UI}
For the reimplementation, jQuery UI's sortable was used.
The html was rewritten, so that the draggable elements is represented as li's in a ul in stead of a table.
The ul with id 'sortable', is set to be sortable, and after every update, checkVictory() is run to check if the list is correctly sorted.
The check is done by comparing the text of the current span-element with the next and checking if the first number is larger then the next. If so, the variable 'isSorted' which is initialiced to true before every check is set to false, and the game is not yet won.
If all the checks are done, and 'isSorted' is still true, the game is won, and an alert is displayed. Then the game is reset.
