\section*{Drag-and-drop with jQuery UI}
For the reimplementation, jQuery UI's sortable was used.
The html was rewritten, so that the draggable elements is represented as li's in a ul in stead of a table.
The ul with id 'sortable', is set to be sortable, and after every update, checkVictory() is run to check if the list is correctly sorted.
The check is done by comparing the text of the current span-element with the next and checking if the first number is larger then the next. If so, the variable 'isSorted' which is initialiced to true before every check is set to false, and the game is not yet won.
If all the checks are done, and 'isSorted' is still true, the game is won, and an alert is displayed. Then the game is reset.

\section*{Performance comparison}
To test the performance of the two ways of accessing attributes, two
for loops were created - one for each way.  Both loops change the
style attribute twice (the background alternates between red and
blue), and reads them between each step.  Both get a new date object
before the loop and after the loop, enabling a comparison in time.
Both loops run 10.000 times.

Strangely enough the behavior when tested actually contradicts the
statement from the lecture.  It seems that Firefox is consistent with
the statement whereas Chrome and reconq switch a bit between
confirming and contradicting, although both seems to contradict almost
consistently and the confirmation of the statement is the exception.
Another thing noted is that Chrome seems to do some optimization
(cache of the function results perhaps?), because after some tests,
the set/getAttribute-way took around 8-10 ms for all 10.000 calls.

This is most likely due to a lot of optimization in Chrome, and it is
suspected that if more attributes had been included in the test the
picture would have been different.

\section*{Inheritance}
The inheritance is done using prototypejs, which made it fairly easy.
To make testing easier it has been made so the user can fill in a name
and press what kind of pet is desired.  Since the target audience here
is developers who intend to break the behavior, there is no validation
of the fields.  Thus tests such as accessing the empty property name
is possible.  The UI though does not encapsulate trying to instantiate
non-existing objects, but this can be tested through the JavaScript
console.
