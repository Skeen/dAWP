The Cat and Dog system is a fair deal easier to make with natural
class implementations.  Especially hiding properties is easier as
there's support in Dart for library private variables by using the
underscore naming convention.

One thing that became harder was making a tester for trying to force
properties to be revealed.  This had to be done by using Darts
reflection framework $mirrors$.
