\subsection*{Server}
\indent\indent The server can be started using ex6/server/bin/run.sh \\
\noindent The server loads a list of image paths at start-up, and creates a mapping from imageIDs to image paths. It initializes a map from imageIDs to comment strings as well.

The server hosts a \verb|REST API|, with 3 entry points;
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|/list_images|: Which returns a JSON mapping imageIDs to image paths.
\item \verb|/get_comments?imageID=ID|: Which retrieves comments for the url-argument passed \verb|ID|, or returns an error.
The answer is always in JSON format, on succes it has two fields; \verb|imageID = ID| (string --> string), and \verb|comments = image_comments| (string --> list string).
\item \verb|/post_comment?imageID=ID\&comment=com|: Which posts a comment \verb|com| for the image corresponding to the url-argument passed \verb|ID|.
The answer is in JSON format, when an error occurs, otherwise empty.
\end{itemize}

The code was originally written using \verb|await| and \verb|async|, but we had issues with useless compiler errors, alike the one below;
\begin{verbatim}
runtime/vm/flow_graph_builder.cc:2226: error: unreachable code
\end{verbatim}
A lot of these, very unspecific errors lead us to leave the keyword approach, for the standard old \verb|Future<T>| one, and synchronous code.
