% Rewrite the AngularJS form validator such that the form described in fieldsets.json is dynamically loaded, displayed using the template mechanism of AngularJS, and properly validated (with colors). Your application should generate HTML similar to form-validator-dynamic-example.html (ignoring colors).
% Hint: You can use the ng-if directive in the HTML code to generate separate HTML code for paragraphs and input fields.
