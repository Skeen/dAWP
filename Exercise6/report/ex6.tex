% Create an AngularJS directive that can be used as follows to show a number of stars (like in the homework peer-reviewing system):
% <rating stars="3" max="5" />
% Bonus: make it possible to adjust the rating by clicking on a star, and such that a callback is triggered whenever the user changes the rating (allowing, for instance, the client code to send the changes to the server).
