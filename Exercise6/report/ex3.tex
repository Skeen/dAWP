% Consider the Pet/Dog/Cat exercise from week 2. Can you solve all exercise parts using TypeScript classes and modules?
The basics of the class system is trivially solvable using typescript
(example in the corresponding folder is provided). If the desired
properties with truely private and immutable properties is to be
achieved it will take more work.  Most likely such an
implementation will require a lot more twirking and will most likely
end up (almost) as clunky as the original.  But as it can be done with
JavaScript it can also be done with TypeScript.
