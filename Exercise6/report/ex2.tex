% Re-implement the multiset datatype from week 1 using TypeScript. Make sure to take advantage of the new features in TypeScript.
The multiset in TypeScript is fairly easy.  One thing that could have
been done to make it resemble the Java version more is to use the
generics from TypeScript, which hasn't been done here.  Apart from
that it's quite straight forward using classes.

Two noteworthy things is that using classes makes the one-shot
closures becomes less natural (although still possible) for
encapsulating $trueRemove$ and the internal data types and that
TypeScript does not like the overload with two different return types.
This would probably be best handled by dividing it up in two functions
with different names.
