Stored XSS vs AJAX
The following string enters the attack
", foo: function() {alert("You got hacked");}(), bar: "
The idea springs from the data structure returned in: http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/604177436824/feed.gtl?uid= (where the number is your profile number), where the JavaScript structure can be augmented with a one-shot-closure.
